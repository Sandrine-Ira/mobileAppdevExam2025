# BudgetWise - Smart Budget Management App

**Student Registration Number:** 22RP03352  
**Academic Year:** 2024-2025  
**Module:** Mobile Application Development (ITLMA701)  
**Developer:** Sandrine Irah

## 📱 App Overview

BudgetWise is a budget management mobile application built with Flutter that helps users track their expenses, manage budgets by category, and visualize their spending with simple analytics and progress indicators.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**The Problem:** Many people struggle with managing their personal finances due to:
- Lack of awareness about spending patterns
- Difficulty tracking expenses across multiple categories
- No clear visualization of budget vs. actual spending

**Our Solution:** BudgetWise provides an intuitive, user-friendly platform that:
- Simplifies expense tracking and categorization
- Provides real-time budget monitoring with visual progress indicators
- Offers a basic analytics screen for premium users (advanced analytics planned)

## 👥 Target Audience

- Young professionals and students managing personal budgets
- Anyone who wants a simple, mobile-first budgeting tool

## 🏆 Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

- **Category-Based Budgeting:** Easy-to-use interface for setting and tracking budgets by category
- **Visual Progress:** Progress bars and circular indicators for budget utilization
- **Firebase-Powered:** Secure, scalable cloud-based data storage

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

BudgetWise uses a **freemium monetization strategy**:

- **Free users:**
  - Access all core budgeting and expense features
  - See banner ads (Google AdMob) in the app
- **Premium (UI only, payment not implemented):**
  - Removes ads
  - Unlocks access to the Analytics screen (currently a placeholder)

### **Commission-Based Monetization (Affiliate Link)**
- The app includes a commission-based monetization feature via an affiliate link (Amazon).
- When users click the "Shop on Amazon (Affiliate)" button, they are redirected to Amazon using a referral link.
- Each click is tracked using Firebase Analytics (`ad_interaction` event with `adType: 'affiliate'`).
- In a real deployment, this would use a valid affiliate ID to earn commissions on qualifying purchases. For this assessment, the affiliate link is a placeholder and no real commissions are earned.

> **Note:** Payment/subscription logic is not implemented. The "Go Premium" button is for demonstration only. No real money is collected in this version.
> **Bonus:** Payment gateway integration is not implemented (bonus marks only).
> 
> **Why No Real Income Collection:** This is a student project focused on demonstrating technical skills and monetization concepts. Real payment processing, affiliate accounts, and ad revenue require business registration, compliance, and published app status - the app has not been published yet.
